# project-0-ccd-calibration-dmock-sl
This data and this notebook was created in completion of the first project in an Upper Division / Graduate Level Astronomy lab course at UT Austin.
The purpose of this first lab was to familiarize us with the workings of a modern research telescope and introduce us to the calibration, error reduction, and data wrangling procedures we would have to do for every observation with a telescope in order to insure that our data was as accurate as possible.
The data, code, and lab report can all be found in this repository.
